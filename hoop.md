## Why Should This Game Exist Now?

Firstly, sports games need a shakeup. The tentpole 2K series is regularly criticized for both being formulaic and for being microtransaction-heavy. The time is ripe for an indie sports game with a different style of simulation, as shown by the success of Tape 2 Tape.

*Hoop Dungeon* is also built to appeal to fans of indie roguelikes. This is a very established audience and the basketball setting helps *Hoop Dungeon* stand out in a genre that leans SFF.

Additionally, games like *Hades* show the potential of narrative in roguelikes and *Hoop Dungeon*'s innovative approach to narrative will appeal to players looking for more in that space. Additionally, despite the popularity of sports anime, the narrative techniques they use are rare to see in video games and so have significant appeal.
