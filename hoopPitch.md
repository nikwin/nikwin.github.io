## Why Should This Game Exist Now?

Firstly, sports games need a shakeup. The tentpole 2K series is regularly criticized for both being formulaic and for being microtransaction-heavy. The time is ripe for an indie sports game with a different style of simulation, as shown by the success of Tape 2 Tape.

*Hoop Dungeon* is also built to appeal to fans of indie roguelikes. This is a very established audience and the basketball setting helps *Hoop Dungeon* stand out in a genre that leans SFF.

Additionally, games like *Hades* show the potential of narrative in roguelikes and *Hoop Dungeon*'s innovative approach to narrative will appeal to players looking for more in that space. Additionally, despite the popularity of sports anime, the narrative techniques they use are rare to see in video games and so have significant appeal.

## The Team

I make up the entire team right now. I'm Nikhil Murthy. I've shipped two games as a solo developer; *The Quiet Sleep* and *Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation*.

## Community and Marketing

I would prefer to focus on the development of the game and trust in the publisher for marketing. I plan however on promoting the game through social media and through interviews as well as managing the game forums and discussion boards.

## Production

- Nov '25: Steam page live
- Dec '25: Content complete
- Feb '26: Early Access release
- Mar '26: First content expansion
- Apr '26: Second content expansion
- May '26: Third content expansion

*Hoop Dungeon* marks one year of development in September, 2025. The core of the game is already in place but only the MVP for the narrative is implemented. I plan to expand that to all of the characters in the game as well as add a few more pieces to make the narrative pop.

Additionally, I have some technical features left to implement. Display options, controller support and localization are all planned for Early Access but have not been implemented yet.

## What do I need?

All that I require for *Hoop Dungeon* is marketing support. I plan to fund the remainder of the development myself but I would like to partner with a publisher to get this game to the players who will enjoy it.
