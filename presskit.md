Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation

- Title: Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation
- Website: [http://www.whynotgames.in/](http://www.whynotgames.in/)
- Platforms:
  - Steam (PC) - [https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712530/Nikhil_Murthys_Syphilisation/](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712530/Nikhil_Murthys_Syphilisation/)
  - Itch (PC) - [https://whynotgames.itch.io/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation](https://whynotgames.itch.io/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation)
- Price: USD: 14.99
- Description: *Nikhil Murthy's Syphilisation* is a post-colonial 4X game where you play a student doing a group report on Gandhi, Churchill and the Raj. It eXplores space left uncharted by the genre and so proposes alternatives to established systems. 
- History: When reading *Ulysses* by James Joyce, I came across the term Syphilisation and happened to be thinking about parody in video games at that time. The game just fell into place from there.
- Features:
  - Research actual facts about Gandhi, Churchill and the Raj.
  - Try empathy in a 4X game. Play opportunistically if you must, but don't expect to be treated as clever for doing so.
  - Experience some amount of history from below.
  - eXplore 4X systems that are not rooted in imperialism.

- Description: *The Quiet Sleep* is a city builder/tower defense game that is set in your mind. It's about building out different parts of your personality to achieve goals and deal with issues.
- History: The mechanical overlap between city-building games and tower defense games intrigued me and having it represent thinking seemed fitting.

  - Handle various life situations, including talking to people, finding a job and trying to overthrow a local government.
  - Set up structures to keep emotions from overwhelming you!
  - Balance keeping things close enough to your self to run smoothly and far enough to be safe from them.
