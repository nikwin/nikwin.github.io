- Description: The Quiet Sleep is a city builder/tower defense game that is set in your mind. It's about building out different parts of your personality to achieve goals and deal with issues.
- History: The mechanical overlap between city-building games and tower defense games intrigued me and having it represent thinking seemed fitting.
- Features:
  - Build out a personality and watch your mind develop.
  - Handle various life situations, including talking to people, finding a job and trying to overthrow a local government.
  - Set up structures to keep emotions from overwhelming you!
  - Balance keeping things close enough to your self to run smoothly and far enough to be safe from them.
