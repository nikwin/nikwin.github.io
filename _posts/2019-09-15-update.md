You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/manifesto).

## Work Done

I rebuilt the entire tech tree this week from eXploration to eXploitation. The final phase of the game is still pretty undeveloped, so I didn't do anything for that yet. I'm going to finish the research tree for this part too and then play what I have until I'm both happy and familiar with how it plays out and then I will flesh out the ending. I've made some major changes to how beliefs work and how colonial economies work and so have also changed the way the currencies work in the game. I took out the old split of raw and derived currencies and made each district correspond to a pair of currencies. I also just cleaned out the techs. This is a top-down skeleton that I put in place now and then I'm going to muddy it with some bottom up stuff.

## Interesting Fact

I don't have an interesting fact as such this week, but I do have a quote that I want to put here from "The Home and the World" by Rabindranath Tagore. It is spoken by one of the main characters, Nikhil, as he is in conversation with his techer and he says "It was Buddha who conquered the world, not Alexander - this is untrue when stated in dry porse - oh when shall we be able to sing it?"
