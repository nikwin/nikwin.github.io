You can buy a very early version of Syphilisation [here](https://whynotgames.itch.io/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation). You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

The past month has been entirely about streamlining the game to make it easier to play. There are a ton of bugfixes, UI improvements and minor tweaks. I'm trying to get the game ready for a wider release and right now, that just means getting it to be more playable. If you're interested in seeing what it does so far, please try it out and tell me what you think. The post-colonialism is not quite complete yet, but there's still plenty here to latch on to, especially if you're looking for innovation in the 4X space.
