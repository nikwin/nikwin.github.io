You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

The game is now completely stable with what is there, so I have the space to build it out a bit. I designed out the next set of things for the regions of the game. I want to fix some things about how the regions work, especially in the early game. I want to avoid the manifeset destiny aspect of the whole phase. I'm spending a lot more time on the early game than I would like, but it is far and away the part of the game that people play the most. I'll write out the full thing later as I think it's worth detailing a little bit.

## Interesting Fact

I learned a lot of interesting things this week, but I don't want to distract from the real thing that I want to talk about this week, the protests in India against the NRC. I don't feel like I'm the best person to summarize the events, but there's no shortage of those online. I spent a couple of times there and I want to show you the photos now.

More than that though, I wanted to show you this photo from Mumbai. The crowds are at the August Kranti Maidan, where Gandhi issued his Quit India speech in 1942, which I really appreciate.
