The new *Hoop Dungeon* playtest is now live! You can check it out here - [https://whynotgames.itch.io/hoop-dungeon-prototype](https://whynotgames.itch.io/hoop-dungeon-prototype).

I'm fascinated by how much time is spent on each match in sports anime. I believe that translating that style of storytelling to games may have some very interesting results. Games often reduce down to solving a crossword puzzle to turn a page and this has the potential to warp that in interesting ways. You can read more about that [here](https://whynotgames.in/2025/03/25/hoopQuestion.html).

This *Hoop Dungeon* playtest holds the skeleton for one of these translations. It's also, if I do say so myself, quite a fun basketball tactics game. Give it a shot and let me know what you think!
