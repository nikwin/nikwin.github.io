<h2>[An Early Note On The Aesthetics of *Syphilisation*](/blog/syph/earlyAesthetics)</h2>

It's still very early in the development of *Syphilisation* (announcement post [here](/blog/syph/announce)), so this is very subject to change, but I thought that I would put down some early thoughts on what my goals for this game are. The high level concept of creating a parody of *Civilization* to comment on some of the statements implicit in its design is a good starting point, but I need to drill a little deeper into that to get something to work with.


My current aesthetics are:
- A discussion of Churchill.
- The ability to play for reasons other than being better than the other players.
- Space to choose your position on each of the above points. This needs to allow for complex and non-binary positions.
- Reasons to modify your plans and previously held stances.



A game that does well at conveying these aesthetics is probably going to be a good realization of what I have in my head right now. What do you think?
