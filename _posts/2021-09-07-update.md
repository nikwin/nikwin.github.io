You can buy a very early version of Syphilisation  on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712530/Nikhil_Murthys_Syphilisation/) or [Itch](https://whynotgames.itch.io/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation). You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

I completed two major features; an update to the game's pacing and the merging of the preserves, districts and camps. I really hope that these features will result in a much more streamlined game and one that's easier to understand. However, I feel that they are not quite ready for release yet. I am not comfortable with the amount of testing they've had.


I really don't want to release anything insufficiently tested right now as I am going to be on holiday from the 8th to the 13th. During this time, I will not check any of my workspaces and so will be unavailable. If you need me for something, please reach out on the game forums, my personal e-mail or Twitter and I'll respond once I'm back.
