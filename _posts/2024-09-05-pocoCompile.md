Here is all my postcolonial work and writing, compiled into a single source.

Firstly, you can get Syphilisation at either of the following links. Syphilisation is my postcolonial 4X game in which you play a student doing a group report on Gandhi, Churchill and the Raj. This is the implementation of my postcolonial theories.
