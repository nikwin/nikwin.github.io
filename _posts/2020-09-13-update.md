You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

I did not get anything interesting done this week. All of my work was bugfixes and minor quality-of-life features. There were a lot of little visual updates too. I also put in dragging the screen around with the mouse, which is important because it lets me play the game with just my stylus and not the keyboard.


Incidentally, I also played some *EU4*, which makes me feel much happier about the complexity of *Syph*. I'm not going to listen too much to that siren though. I'll be a lot happier if the complexity barrier isn't anywhere near as high as *EU4*. I'm sticking to my compromise of assuming that the player is comfortable with 4X games, but *EU* style interfaces are a bridge too far, I'm really looking forward to spending more time with *EU4* myself though.


The next week is going to have a hard feature-lock. The goal is to be able to play the game from beginning to end and the next week is entirely for fixing bugs that would keep me from doing that. Anything that's not explicitly a bug is going to have to wait.
