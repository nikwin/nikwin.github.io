desc: The RPS review of Foundation compares it to a warm bath and I absolutely love that

I absolutely love [this early access review](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2019/02/08/foundation-review-early-access/) of *Foundation* by Alec Meer for RPS. Translating the experience of playing a video game into the terms of taking a bath is exactly the kind of thing I want to see all the time in game reviews.


I don't want reviews that tell me what a game is made up of. I want them to tell me what it feels like when I play it and comparing it to things that aren't games is the best way to do that. It's good for me as a reader and it's very good for me as a game designer. When a review tells me the pieces and expects me to know how it plays, that means that there's not enough being done with those pieces. If I'm reading a review of a dish, telling me that it has eggs tells me something, but I'd much rather know if it's a dessert or lunch and I want even more to know if it tastes like a warm bath so that I can decide that for myself.


I want reviews to understand that both a bath and a video game can be a nice way to rewind and while I might want to rewind in the manner of taking a long bath, I want to do it while playing a game on my computer and that my computer doesn't fit in my bathroom.


Also, I've always just liked translations. I love the work that Pippin Barr does because of how it tickles my mind. The point in the review about the maintenance of adding a little hot water to a bath that's cooled down a little and needing to fiddle a bit with trade to get back in the black in *Foundation* really has me thinking.


Basically, I want these reviews to do some of my work for me. I know that *Better Oblivion Community Center* by Conor Oberst and Phoebe Bridgers and *Early Work* by Andrew Martin are the same genre, but I want to know if *Life Is Strange* is part of it too. I think so, because *BOCC* and Sufjan Stevens are the same genre and Sufjan Stevens and *Captain Spirit* are the same genre and so *BOCC* and *Life Is Strange* have to be the same genre. I assume this means *Manchester By The Sea* is too, but I've never seen that so I don't know.


See, once I know what all falls in a genre, then I have a much wider range of places to steal from. When I realized that *The Quiet Sleep* was magical realism, that let me steal from *Asterios Polyp* and Kazuo Ishiguro and suddenly I was no longer blocked. Now, if I'm ever stuck while making a game of the style of *Foundation*, I'm going to take a bath and read the Horseshoe Project on cozy games.
