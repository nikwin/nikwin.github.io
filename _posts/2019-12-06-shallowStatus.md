desc: A shallow status check on the Syphilisation big picture
---


*Syphilisation* is stabilizing and I should be able to have people play an early version soon, so I wanted to note out the big things on my mind that I want to get done for the game. I'm going to come back and do this more thoroughly later, but I felt that putting a bit down here would make sense.

## What *Civ* Says

I've spent a bit of time thinking out exactly what it is that the *Civ* series says through its mechanics and the semantic values of the pieces, but I need to spend some time doing so in a more deliberate manner. A large part of why I'm building this game is to function as a parody of the *Civ* series. I think that video games need more parodies as a way to promote video game literacy. My hope is that they will serve to make clearer what games and their systems say by showing more of the space around them. I feel that we can then thus develop the skills to see these more clearly and more easily without the aid of external parodies.


So, it follows that I need to spend a fair bit of effort fully detailing what *Civ* says so that I make an effective commentary on it. I've naturally identified a number of major headings, but I want to spend the focused time on it to see what I might be missing.

## Nationalism

Tied deeply into *Civ* is the concept of the nation-state. It feels almost inextricable and I still need to do a lot more work to combat that in *Syph*. It's fundamental to a very large part of how *Civ* works and so is non-trivial to approach


The most fundamental difference between *Civ* and *Syph* is that *Syph* is not built around the idea of a single winner. That one concept and the zero-sum thinking that it necessitates is the source of most of what is most worth questioning in *Civ* and additionally is one of the places where it breaks down the most. It's an artifact of the game's nature and history, but fundamentally conflicts with the idea of building a civilization. I don't want any country to engage in a war of opportunity, least of all the one I live in, and the inability of *Civ* to represent a civilization of that style is one of its greatest flaws. Letting the player decide what to compete on and how competitive to be changes the game drastically and I still need to fully understand the ramifications.

## History From Below

*Civ* has a strong history-from-above perspective. It's completely focused on the idea of great people leading a nation and I want this game to have a history-from-below skew to it, at least in comparison. I want the game to feel much more organic than the somewhat antiseptic *Civ*. This side of the game is very underdeveloped and I need to add a lot to make this feeling come through

## Tech Trees

Tech trees form the spine of the *Civ* series. They give it a lot of the forward momentum that drives the one-more-turn part of the game. The narrative of an overarcing tech inevitability is, I feel, blinkered. I want a more fluid-feeling tech tree for *Syph*. Additionally, this should help with the issue of how *Civ* games often feel similar.


The other big part of this is that I need to integrate tech skepticism into the game. The allure of tech solutions will be there naturally due to the *Civ* framework, which unquestionably believes in them, but I want to put in something that allows for aggressive skepticism here.


This is what I'm in the middle of working on currently when not stabilizing. There's still a lot to do here though.

## Industrialization

Similarly, I want the game to allow the player to question industrialization and development as a whole. I have some non-industrial options planned and I want to be able to represent a Gandhian village system and also a deep ecology stance. I also want to take advantage of the framing of *Syph* as a set of people doing a group project and criticize the industrialization of relationships and the ensuing pollution caused.
