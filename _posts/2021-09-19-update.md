You can buy a very early version of Syphilisation  on [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1712530/Nikhil_Murthys_Syphilisation/) or [Itch](https://whynotgames.itch.io/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation). You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

I finally updated the long-promised merging of the game's preserves, districts and camps as well as the update to the game's pacing. I merged the preserve, camps and districts to all be the same thing and then routed the favor system through that as well. Now, exploring and completing quests will make districts that are the same as the ones that you can build in the cities. The player that controls the most of these in a region also controls the city.


I also simplified the game flow. I removed a few superfluous steps, notably now unlocking points automatically unlocks the projects too. You no longer need to write notes. The report menu now gives you more guidance for how to progress in the report.


Also, I streamlined the eXploitation phase so you should now get the decks quicker and there are more projects to use the eXploitation phase currencies in.


I hope you have fun!
