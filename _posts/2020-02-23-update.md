You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

I've been working a lot on getting the tech decks in place. The game functioned fairly well into the mid-game before I put that feature in, but now the whole thing needs to be heavily redone because of how fundamental a change it is. It's much more postcolonial now as a result, and it makes the game feel very different from *Civilization*, but it's not quite where I want it to be yet. I did a lot to restructure the parameters, but this is one of those features that needs to be played through a number of times. Also, I think that I will need to build out more parts to the feature. It's exciting, but I was looking forward to getting people to start playing the game and it looks like I will have to put that off for a while. On the plus side though, it makes authoring more content a much, much easier proposal due to how decoupled it now is.

## Interesting Fact

There are options here, but I think it's worth explaining why there haven't been any updates for a while.

No more personal updates for a while though.
