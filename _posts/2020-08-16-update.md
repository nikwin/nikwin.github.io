You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

These past few weeks have all been about getting the game ready for other people to play. I did a lot of work on it, but there's not much to say that's interesting about it. I did put in some rudimentary AI though and that's exciting. Now, there's a lot more tension in the early game.


My early playtesters have not had a great time with the game. I had a bug in my build process that made the game resolution much smaller than it should be and that really hurt the play experience for my early testers. Besides that, they brought up some good points about communicating information to early players that I have to work on. In particular, I want players to see the end-goal of the report from the beginning so that players know what they're building towards and I should put in a basic Civilopedia so that I can fully explain some of the concepts.


Also, I really want to put an early anti-colonial hook into the game to sell players on the game's concept. I'm not sure what exactly that should be though, so I'll think it out. I'm thinking about something that respects the land as more than just something to exploit.

## Interesting Fact

Independence Day just passed, marking 73 years of Independence.
