You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/manifesto).

## Work Done

I put in some of the end-game this week. The code is in place right now for apocalyptic climate change, apocalyptic nuclear warfare and adding conclusions to your book report. I've played the game a lot as well, but I haven't quite got to the end-game scenarios yet. It takes a lot of playtime to get the game into shape and I still have a lot of playing to do.

## Interesting Fact

*The Book of Tea* is an essay written in 1906 linking the tea ceremony to Japanese life. It was originally written in English and aimed at a Western audience. I've mentioned this before, but the Meiji restoration and the industrialization of Japan on its own terms was a major talking point for both Indian and Western intellectuals at the time as it promised an Eastern solution to the question of modern culture. With this context, *The Book of Tea* was written less as a way to introduce people to the art of tea and more as a way to introduce the concept of simplicity. It posits "Nowadays industrialism is making true refinement more and more difficult all the world over. Do we not need the tea-room more than ever?"
