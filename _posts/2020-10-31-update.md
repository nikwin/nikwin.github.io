You can buy a very early version of Syphilisation [here](https://whynotgames.itch.io/nikhil-murthys-syphilisation). You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/newManifesto).

## Work Done

The past two weeks were focused on combat. A lot of the work was minor tweaks to just try to get the pieces working better. I cleaned up some key code and fleshed out a couple of things that I had left as stubs with the hope that these changes would do more to get the players involved in actions with other players. This helped a bit, but not all that much.


Besides this, I figured out how I wanted to differentiate the kind units versus the brutal and devious ones. This is something that I had tried to figure out for a while and I like the solution in place right now, but I still need to tweak the numbers here to get the feel right. I now have kind units transfer currency to the players they are used against and devious ones steal. Right now though, the currency economy is too broken for me to really see how it plays.


I also put in discussion points that emerge from working on the report. The game then pushes you to discuss these points with the other players, which starts an action. I still don't have this parametered out either. It doesn't happen frequently enough right now.
