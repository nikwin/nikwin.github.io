  <h2 id="sec-1"><span class="section-number-2">1</span> Things that the focus system has done well</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Low focus generating will
      </li>
      <li>High focus consuming will
      </li>
      <li>Keeping the towers near the traits
      </li>
      <li>Giving the player a reward for leveling up a trait
      </li>
      <li>Penalties from trying to run everything at once:
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Will cost when it was just a number.
          </li>
          <li>Reduced efficiency with workers
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>The trait leveling giving you more focus had the reasonable metaphor of getting better at something letting you do the same task with less focus
      </li>

<div id="outline-container-sec-2" class="outline-2">
  <h2 id="sec-2"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Good Metaphors</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-2">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>subconscious being more active when focus used is low
      </li>
      <li>Needing to keep the focus high to prevent emotions from being as strong.
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>This means that people should not be able to decide how much they are going to focus on a thing
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>Goals only generating desire if focused on.
      </li>
      <li>Generating workers represented dividing focus very well
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Needing y workers but only having x and so everything runs at x/y efficiency was quite good
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>Workers as a whole are a good metaphor
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Visually nice
          </li>
          <li>Supports the feeling of the mind being a lot of little people
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>Being able to vary the amount of focus that you spend on something for variable efficiency is actually strong
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>There are actions for which you can do this in the real world
          </li>
          <li>There are also actions where you cannot
          </li>
          <li>There is a range in the real world
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>I would like this entire system to be a little less under the control of the player
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>I don't have full control on what I'm focusing on.
          </li>

  <h2 id="sec-3"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Problems with the current system</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-3">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>It is a pain to manually set focus
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>The two step process of activate tower and set focus is a pain.
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>Possibly too similar to the currency system
      </li>
      <li>No reason not to max focus all the time.
      </li>
      <li>Different actions should require different amounts of focus

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-4">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>How do multiple towers work?
        <ul class="org-ul">

  <h2 id="sec-5"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Sub-proposal - UI change for goals</h2>
  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-5">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Reduce the effort of setting focus through a UI change
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Put all of the towers and the traits involved in running a goal in the goal menu and turn things on from there.
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>Variations:
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Should still put the towers and traits in even if you can't turn them on yourself so as to emphasize the chain
          </li>

      <li>Pieces solved:
        <ul class="org-ul">

      <li>Make the subconscious
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Make the subconscious feed the resources
            <ul class="org-ul">
              <li>This is tricky when the pipeline depends on the resources

      <li>Make the focus and subconscious come from the player to emphasize their zero-sum nature
      </li>
      <li>Make the subconscious choose its destination randomly
      </li>
      <li>Question:
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>How much control do you have over the split?
          </li>

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-7">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Make the player get tired when they have spent focus for too long
      </li>
      <li>Make an entity that generates focus
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>Make it take will, but less will than is normally generated at low focus

          </li>

              <li>I like this anyway, and I should do it

          <li>Can coalesce this and the awake goal
            <ul class="org-ul">
              <li>Can then use this as a metaphor for waking up in the morning

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-8">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Workers are generated from the traits by sending them focus
      </li>
      <li>Variations:
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>The traits generate a number of workers based off their level and the amount of focus set to it.
            <ul class="org-ul">
              <li>Multiple workers can go to a single tower, and efficiency is increased if they do.
              </li>
            
          </li>
          <li>The workers generated by the trait can be more efficient based off the level, but you make one per focus
            <ul class="org-ul">
              <li>The major advantage of this is that we can then take away the manual steps by doing this.

      <li>Remove the focus system entirely

          <li>Many metaphors are lost

          <li>Need to examine the traits and their growth.

  <div class="outline-text-2" id="text-11">
    <ul class="org-ul">
      <li>Requiring the subconscious changes the flow of working on the goals
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>It also means that we have to store currencies, although we can reset them at the end of the day.
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>It feels like there are just a lot of things moving around
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>The complexity seems high
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>It feels too similar to existing currencies, and threatens to overshadow them
      </li>
      <li>It is really hard to see why a tower is not working and what to do about it.
      </li>
      <li>The number of demands on the subconscious grows quickly.
        <ul class="org-ul">
          <li>This becomes a problem when you're waiting on certain mines
          </li>
        
      </li>
      <li>Taking out the two step part of focus made this system play a lot better
      </li>
      <li>Making you focus on work until you run out of will/energy to run a tower because your mines aren't running is a good metaphor
      </li>

          <li>Solves the issue of keeping like buildings together

          <li>Reduces the issue of rewarding players for leveling traits by reducing the importance of the traits

          <li>Should visually separate the mind nicely.

              <li>Focus going through the traits to go to the towers feels weak to me.
              </li>
              <li>Having a trait grow and so getting more space to build on that trait feels stronger

          <li>Low focus generating will

              </li>
            
          </li>
          <li>Much lower complexity burden, much easier to communicate
