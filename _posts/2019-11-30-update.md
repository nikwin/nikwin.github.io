You can read about what *Syphilisation* is [here](/blog/syph/announce) and the manifesto for the game [here](/blog/syph/manifesto).

## Work Done

This week was once again playtesting. The game is quite stable now to a quite deep degree. There are quite a few fixes to get done next week, but I should be able to finish them over the course of it.


I also have a major feature planned. The tech tree now is just out of control in the amount that it presents to you. I'm going to make the techs get surfaced organically instead of through the rigid structure of a tech tree. I want more of the game to come from below, in contrast with the clear history-from-above angle of *Civ*.

## Interesting Fact

This is going to be the final excerpt from *Colonialism and Neocolonialism*, which I very much enjoyed. It's a quote by Fanon which struck me, "We black people are good, we have a horror of cruelty. For a long time, I believed that the men of Africa would not fight each other. Alas, black blood is being spilled, black men are spilling it, and it will be spilled for a long time to come. The whites are leaving, but their accomplices are among us, armed by them. The last battle of the colonized against the colonizers will often be that of the colonized among themselves."
